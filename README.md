# Integrating badges using a Chrome Web Extension

This project provides an API for installing a Chrome Web Extension that allows for integration of badges on several research websites.

## Installation

In order to use this API, make sure that you have installed [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and enabled extensions in Settings.

Next, clone our repository:

`git clone https://zivgitlab.uni-muenster.de/geocontainer-badges/reproducability`

Open the Chrome browser > Click the three dots in the top right corner > Settings > Extensions > Load Unpacked Extension... > Select the folder containing the repository.

### Run in Chrome
Upon succesful installation, ou'll notice an 'O2R' icon in the top-right corner next to the URL line. Navigate to your chosen website, search for the name of the research
you are interested in, and click the 'O2R' button to assess the search results.
